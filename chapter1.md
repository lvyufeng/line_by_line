# Loose, Baggy Sentences
---
"Omit needless words," say Strunk and White, practicing what they preach. Their terse injunction sums up advice included in every contemporary style manual. Under a variety of headings--Officialese, Prolixity, Verbiage, Periphrasis, Windyfoggery, and Jargon--the experts agree that, when it comes to exposition, less is usually more. Surely most authors have read such advice or have heard similar strictures in composition classed, but economy and precision seem hard to come by.

Bad  prose proliferates because writers model their style on what they read most, and their daily fare--whether textbooks, reports, memorandums, or newspapers--abounds in circumlocution. Educators, sociologists, scholars, lawyers, bureaucrats, technicians, and business executives are all notorious producers of gobbledygook. Here, for example, is a bank president addressing stockholders in a 1980 annual report:

    With the beginning of the new '80s, it is readily 
    ascertainable that there has been little if any improvement in 
    the overall national or general local economy. It is expected 
    by some economists that a general upturn on the national 
    level should come about sometime during mid-1981.
    However, with the increase in taxes starting in January,
    mainly an increase in social security, this will reduce the 
    amount of fee funds available for the stimulation of
    consummer spending.

Someone less given to beating around the bush might have written:
    
    In 1980 we saw little if any improvement in the economy,
    national or local, and although some economists expect an
    upturn in mid-1981, the tax increase scheduled to begin in 
    January, mainly for social security, will leave consumers
    with less money to spend.

A simple statement like this is usually harder to compose than a verbose one, but even if it came naturally, the banker might prefer the longer version. Straightforward sentences sound unimpressive to many writers, andd officalese, creating tin ears, prepetuates itself. Unchecked by the efforts of learned and vocal opponents, logorrhea plagues the country. It's rather like smoking. This chapter can only warn of the dangers, describe the symptoms, ans prescribe remedies, enabling writers who want to kick the habit to cure themselves.

Before we go on examples and techniques, I should make clear that writing concisely dosen't mean composing sentences like "Me Tarzan, you Jane." It means omitting needless words, the deadwood that does nothing but detract from both substance and style. The pruned sentence must emerge not only leaner and clearer but alse more graceful and more effective than it was, better able to do what you want it to do. Long sentences aren't necessarily wordy, not if every word counts. As good writers know, leisurely sentences have their purpose--to contrast with short ones, say, or to estabish a desired tone. A sentence can be too tight. Sometimes you nned a clause instead of a phrase, a phrase instead of a word. What you're after is a supple style; you don't want to compact your language, trading looseness for density. But you're not likely to run that risk unless you're a compulsive polisher. Condensing to a fault is so rare a failing that it needs only passing mention. Of course, if you'd like to change the last sentence to ***The rarity of overtightness obviates elaboration,*** you have something to worry about.

With these qulifications out of the way, we can turn to the problem of recognizing and excising verbiage. Certain tellale characteristics signal wordy sentences. As you read over your writing, watch for the symptoms described below, try eliminating them in the ways the discussion suggests, and see your style improve.

## PROFILE OF A WORDY SENTENCE

You can almost detect a wordy sentence by looking at it--at least if you can recognize weak verbs, ponderous nouns, and strings of prepositional phrases. Each of these features typifies prolixity, and they often occur in combination.

### Weak Verbs
A rambling, unwieldy sentence generally hangs from a inert verb--the verb ***to be*** *(am, are, is ,was, were, being, been),* some other vague, actionless verb like *have* or *exist,* or a passive form (the verb *to be* plus a past participle; e.g., *is believed, was seen*). Pay attention to ther berbs you use, and when you find a weak one, try substituing something more vigorous. Ask what happens in the sentence. If you haven't expressed the action as a verb, you've prbably buried it in a verbal (the *to* or *ing* form of the verb), an adjective, a noun, or a subordinate clause, as the writers have done in the excerpts quoted below. Exhume the action, make it a verb, and you're almost certain to tighten and enliven the wording.

Consider this sentence, quoted from a computer company's promotional material. It appears in paragraph explaining that the new technology, by enbabing employees to work at home, will affect real estate values:

    More remote, less densely populated suburbs, whose lower 
    values (were) often a function of how far they (were) from 
    work centers, and small towns in rural locations, whose
    lower values (were) a relection of difficulty of earning a 
    living, (are) likely to see considerable appreciation of their 
    property values in the next two decades.

If you check the verbs in this long-winded sentence, you can readily spot the trouble. The verb *to be* occurs in the main clause as well as in subordinates ones--four times in all--while nouns and verbals(***relection, appreciation, earning, to see***) freeze all the action. A little analysis suggests that the "event" in the sentence is the appreciation of property values. When you make ***appreciate*** the principal verb, it attracts the proper subject, and everything else falls into place:

    Since many people will no longer have to commute to work 
    centers to earn a living, property values in the more distant 
    suburbs and rural areas should appreciate considerably in 
    the next two decades.

Notice that the revision eliminates needless words as well as static verbs. While it may seem to leave out information included in the original, the ommitted words tell readers nothing that they don't already know, nothing that isn't implicit in what's left. You could even tighten the wording a bit more:

    Rural and exurban property values should appreciate
    considerably in the next two decades as it becomes easier
    for people to earn a living in areas remote from work centers.

When you consider substitutes for weak and passive verbs, you may have several good options, and the choice will depend on exactly what you want to highlight.

In the following excerpt, from a newspaper article on a town's plans to build an animal shelter, the wordiness stems from the passive voice, the form a verb takes then its subject is not acting but acted on:

    The shelter will be owned by the town, but it will be run by
    members of the humane society and supported, in part, by
    funds raised by them. The bulk of the operating funds,
    however, will be supplied by the town.

When you make all the verbs active, other economies suggest them-selves:

    Although the town will own the shelter and pay most of the 
    operating expenses, members of humane society will run
    the facility and provide additional support through fund raising.

The revision collapses two sentences into one. In the original the passive subjects ***shelter*** and ***bulk of the operating funds*** need verbs of their own, but when ***town*** becomes the acting subject, it can govern two verbs with different objects, thus enabling one clause to supply the same information that formerly required two.

The next example comes from a letter that the head of a college English department sends prospective majors:

    The English Department is unusually strong for a college of 
    this size. It consists of twelve faculty members, whose fields 
    of special interest cover the range of English and American 
    literature. The diversity and educational background of this
    department by its members includes such subjects as 
    Shakespeare, Milton, Jane Austen, Tennyson, Wordsworth, 
    Pope, Melville, and Southern "agrarian" writers, T.S.Eliot 
    and Katherine Anne Porter.

This excerpt has several problems, but notice particularly that the weak main verbs in the three sentences attract needless words, that the second sentence subordinates its primary information(the faculty members' range of intersets), and that the third sentence repeats information given in the second. You might revise this way:

    The twelve faculty members who compose the English
    Department make it an unusually strong one for a college of 
    this size. Their diverse special interests and educational
    backgrounds cover the range of English and American
    literature, and their publications include important works on 
    Shakespeare, Milton, Jane Austen, Tennyson, Wordsworth, 
    Pope, Melville, the Southern "agrarian" writers, T.S.Eliot,
    and Katherine Anne Porter.

As you check your sentences for weak verbs, always consider eliminating leisurely sentence openers like ***There is*** and ***It is important to note that***. You can usually cut them easily, and most sentences work better if you go right to the point instead of sidling up to it. but apparently not all experts agree. A composition manual provides this example:

    There is a hasty way of writing which is counterpart to the 
    hasty way of reading. It is becoming more common every 
    year and raises less and less protest.

Removing the weak verbs leaves:

    A hasty way of writing, counterpart to the hasty way of 
    reading, grows more common every year and raise less and 
    less protest.

But you can condense even more:
    
    Hasty writing, like hasty reading, grows....

A financial columnist wrote the next example:

    To make the most of your investments, it is essential that
    you understand what your goals are and what your financial 
    temperament is.

As always, you can reduce ***it is essencial that*** to ***must*** or ***have to*** and eliminate the ***what*** clauses. Revised, the sentence reads:

    To make the most of your investments, you have to 
    understand your goals and financial temperament.

The last two examples, unlike the earlier ones, may not strike you as especially wordy, and perhaps the revised version do sacrifice emphasis to brevity and directness. If you want that emphasis, ifyou want to draw particular attention to a statement, you can justigy slowing the pace.

No one recommends that you banish the verb ***to be*** and all passive forms from your writing. I wouldn't tamper, certainly, with "To be or not to be, that is the question" or even with "She is more to be pitied than censured." You may choose the passive, for example, because you want to put its subject first in the sentence or because you do not know, or do not want to reveal, who is performing the action. But when you use extra words, make sure that you are doing so purposefully, that you are not just surrendering to laziness and poor craftsmanship. As you edit what you've written, always ***consider*** replacing static verbs. While you should keep those that provide the tone or emphasis or variety you want, you'll find that most sentences benefit when you shift to active verbs.

### Ponderous Nouns

Wordy writing not noly droops from weak verbs but sags under bulky nouns--especially long Latinate ones with endings like ***tion*** and ***ment*** and ***ence***. The two characteristics complement each other. Consider this sentence from a letter to *New York Times*:

    The inference that because high school graduates are more 
    likely to be employed than dropouts, the differences may be
    attributed to the possession of a diploma is suspect since 
    dropouts and graduates may differ in a variety of ways 
    relevant to both graduation prospects and employment status.

lifeless and noun-burdened, the sentence makes dull and difficult reading. You have to grope for the meaning. If you proceed mechanically, looking for verbs to replace and nouns to eliminate, you can eventually pare the sentence down:

    It is not necessarily the diploma that makes high school 
    graduates more employable than dropouts; other differences 
    may affect both their education and their job prospects.

Isn't the shorter version easier to understand? Does the original tell you anything more? Compare the number of nouns and the number of static verbs in the revision, despite that opening ***It is***. Although the sentence could begin ***The diploma does not necessarily make....,*** the more emphatic lead, which adds only two words, stresses the statement as a counterargument.

The next example comes from an article on interdisciplinary college courses. After pointing out that the instructors in such courses teach material in subject areas other than their own, the author goes on to say:

    One of the effects of this purposeful disengagement from
    expertise is that students are disabused of the notion that
    engagement in disciplinary material on a fairly elementary
    level requires mastery of that discipline.

If you ear doesn't tell you that this sentence needs work, the ratio of nouns to active verbs should (not to mention that string of prepositional phrases, the symptom of wordiness discussed in the next section). To revise, first choose an active verb for the main clause. Ask yourself what takes place in the sentence, and you'll find the event confined in a passive verb and tucked away in a subordinate clause--***students are diabused***. To make that idea active, you can either say that instructors, by teaching outside their disciplines, disabuse students of a false notion or that nonspecialist teachers enable students to discover something. Either way you automatically eliminate the limp opening--***One of the effects of.*** A sentence can make clear that something is an effect without using the label, and there's no apparent need to specify that the effect is one of several. (If that information is pertinent, you can include it elsewhere; here it gets in the way.) You might then consider these alternatives:

    By venturing outside their specialties, teachers diabuse
    students of the notion that only those who have mastered a
    discipline can deal with its subject matter.

    When teachers venture outside their specialties, students
    discover that one need not have mastered a discipline to
    deal with its subject matter.

These versions do omit ***on a fairly elementary level,*** but why would students think that "engagement...on a fairly elementary level requires mastery"? Surely they wouldn't expect first-year French students to do without the translations in a Truffacult film. Nevertheless, the omission leaves something to be desired. The revisions almost imply the advisability of having know-nothings pontificate on a subject--an unlikely suggestion in an article favoring interdisciplinary courses. Presumably, then, the original sentence dose not mean what it says. After explaining that instructors teach material ouside their areas of expertise, the author probably intended to make this point:

    By venturing into another field, teachers demonstrate that
    nonspecialists can deal with the subject matter to some
    extent, thus disbusing students of the notion that any
    engagement in the dscipline requires mastery.

Though not much shorter than the original, this version makes its word count.

Here's one more noun-heavy excerpt, this one from a manufacturer's annual report:

    The stability and quality of out financial performance will
    be developed through the profitable execution of our
    existing business, as well as the acquisition or development
    of new businesses.

Before you look at the revision below, try one yourself, following the steps used in ealier examples. The veriage should yield eadily, but the muddy original--perhaps an example of intentional corporate pbfuscation--makes more than one interpretation possible. You may prefer your condensation to this one:

    We will improve our financial performance not only by executing out exsiting business more profitably but by acquiring or developing new businesses.

Do you object to omission of ***stability and quality?*** Would restoring these terms make the revision mean more? You would have a hard time justifying ***quality***, but ***stability*** may be another matter. Although the idea of improved financial performance should encompass the idea of greater stability, readers don't necessarily think about stability when they see ***improve our financial performance,*** and they're nto likely to stop to analyze the phrase. Undoubtedly the sentence concerns a company in which instability has been a problem, and the revision carries no such implication. If the idea is important, you might choose this wording:

    We will work toward a more stable and profitable financial 
    performance not only by executing our existing business
    more efficiently but by acquiring or developing new
    businesses.

### Strings of Prepositional Phrases

As you might expect, strings of prepositional phrase oftem keep company with weak verbs and ponderous nouns. Look closely as any sentence that depends heavily on prepositions, and if you count more than three phrases in a row, consider revising. The following examples exhibit all the symptoms of wordiness we have been discussing; again, even if you can't hear the problem, you can detect it mechanically. The first comes from a doctoral dissertation:

    The more reasoned analysis made by the Saint-Simonians of
    the nature of the new power situation in France and of the 
    reasons the present government could not satisfy the needs 
    of the people was confirmed by these developments.

This sentence features a passive main verb and seven prepositional phrases, four of them consecutive and all with nouns as objects. Changing to the active voice eliminates one phrase and gives you ***These developments confirmed....*** (It also has the advantage, incidentally, of bringing subject and verb closer together, thus making the sentence easier to read.) As you look for expendable phrases, you should see that ***if the nature if the new power situation*** means no more than ***of the new power situation*** and that ***of the reason*** can be left implicit; a ***reasoned analysis*** of the goverment's inability to satisfy would obviously give the underlying reasons. You can cut another phrase by using ***the Saint-Simonians'*** instead of ***made by the Saint-Simonians*** (When an ***of*** or ***by*** phrase simply denotes possession or authorship, you can often substitute the possessive form of the noun. But be careful: not all ***of*** phrases translate into possessive. If, for example, you change ***the assassination of the dictator*** to ***the dictator's assassination***, you risk turning the victim into a murderer.) With four phrases eliminated, the sentence reads:

    These development confirmed the Saint-Simonians' more
    reasoned analysis of the new power situation in France and 
    of the present government's inability to satisfy the people's 
    needs.
